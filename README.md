This repository contains a simple C++ example that highlights a potential pitfall when working with std::vector and raw pointers. The code demonstrates how modifying the vector's contents using a raw pointer obtained from &vec[0] after changing the vector's size or capacity can lead to undefined behavior. This is because the vector's internal memory management might reallocate the underlying array, thus invalidating the raw pointer. The solution demonstrates the safer approach: using iterators or at-access to manipulate vector elements.  This example serves as a cautionary tale regarding the potential dangers of relying on raw pointers with dynamically allocated memory structures. It is crucial to handle vector operations carefully to maintain data integrity and avoid unexpected program crashes. The solution provides safer alternatives for accessing and modifying vector elements.
